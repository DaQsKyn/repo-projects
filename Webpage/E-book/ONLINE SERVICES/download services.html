<div id="Download Services" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Download Services</h3>
  <p> 
	This is when you copy data, usually an entire file, from a main source to a peripheral device. The term is often used to describe the process of copying a file from an online service to one’s own computer. Types of files that can be downloaded 
•	MPG/MPEG- motion picture experts group file 
•	MP3- Motion Layer 3 sound file , this is a highly compressed file 
•	GIF- graphics interchange format, this is the most common image format on the internet 
•	PDF-Portable Document Format for example Adobe Acrobat.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Peer to peer download" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Peer to peer download</h3>
  <p>
	To download a user has to visit a website with any form of download content through a web browser. They should search a key word in the search bar to choose the content they would like to download. This is a very amateur way of downloading which does not include any complex methods of downloading. The only advantage of this method is that it is a secure way of downloading, and the downside is that there is need of surfing through many websites to find the final product. Some of these websites are equipped with authenticity for preventing robots from access.
</p> 
</div>

<div id="Software that assist in downloading" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Software that assist in downloading</h3>
  <p>	For this method of downloading the download browsers come with a default downloader but other download software can be used to manage all downloads and ‘catch’ downloading tasks from any browser for example Internet Download Manager. Also other download managers for example torrent based download engines e.g. www.piratebay.com this is mostly for pirated content. This type of downloading is mostly dependent on others words eg the seeders (uploaders), but to use this type of downloading you are required to have software that opens the torrents eg Bittorrent. The advantage of this type of downloading is that you are able to have very high speeds of downloading, and the disadvantage is that download of an old torrent might be difficult because people might stop seeding 
</p>
</div>
<div id="Music downloads" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Music downloads</h3>
  <p>	Music has greatly impacted our lives today and especially with the youth music takes a large part of their life. One major factor that affects the music industry is the downloading of pirated songs and albums which can be done with torrents, but again you are able to use sites such as www.albumkings.com. Sites like this have newly released albums and soon to be released albums. Other sites like www.beatport.com are sites that allow one to purchase newly released songs and also offer samples of the songs to be downloaded. The main advantage of music downloading is that you save a lot of time and money from no travelling to the store to buy the albums, one main disadvantage is that the music can be very low quality.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Software downloads" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Software downloads</h3>
  <p>	Majority of the software downloads are done from the site itself. The only thing that is taken in consideration is the software being downloaded is freeware (free software) or shareware (purchased software) if you are not willing to pay for a certain software then you  would have to go for the freeware choice which is mostly the trial version which will give you a limited amount of time. The only way the complete version can be obtained is by use of the serial or product key after purchase. An advantage of this type of downloading is that it is very simple and it saves time rather than buying the CD, one disadvantage that most software companies are facing is the spread of pirated and key generated software.
