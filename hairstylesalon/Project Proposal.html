				<h2>Project Proposal</h2>
				<h3>Athens Inc.</h3>
				<p>
					Athens Incorporated, usually referred to as Athens Inc., is a Kenyan Fashion company, headquartered in Nairobi, Kenya, that designs and manufactures clothing and accessories originally focusing on outdoor attire, the fashion house has moved on to the high fashion market developing new and extravagant designs for the new market. Athens was registered on 06 July 2014 by Feisal Hasham when he was done with his course in fashion and design in the Domus University in Milan, Italy.<p> He released his first design of cardigans and totes in 2015, by which time sales were up to Ksh 100,000. With such a positive start Feisal decided to make this his full-time job creating and developing new designs. They were made out of a tough military spec black nylon that his grandfather had used as coverings for steamer trunks.</p><p> Initial success was not instant, as they were hard to sell due to the lack of advertising and high-prices.</p></p>

<p>Having only 1 branch in the city of Nairobi, Mr. Hasham decided that it was time for him to expand and grow his business, that is when he contacted me and told me about his idea of an interactive website. The new and unique fashion that this company offers is like none other, it has the potential to grow into an international brand. Together with traditional hand-made African jewelry. With the collaboration of local designers and Athen designers he was able to create this company.</p>

<p>Mr. Hasham realized that his previous methods of advertising did not reach to the greater market, with initial methods like newspaper articles, radio and word of mouth. That is when he came to me with the idea of this multimedia project which would benefit him with marketing. </p>
				</p>
                <h4>Vision Statement</h4>
				<p>
					To provide the ultimate shopping experience through web, mobile and social media, by research, strategic consulting services and development of bespoke products and outstanding customer service.  </p>
                <h4>Mission Statement</h4>
                <p>To establish a global presence and set industry benchmark for digital shopping by:</p>
<p>•	Adopting best process, quality and ethical standards.</p>
<p>•	Using our experience and expertise to enhance value in stakeholders, money and time.</p>
<p>•	Implementing continuous improvement in work standards to provide maximum customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>•	Developing technological proficiencies.</p>
</p>

<h4>What The Project is About </h4>
				<p>Just like a puzzle games a common and popular form of entertainment, they require the user to manipulate the pieces to fill in the empty regions or identification of objects for example the well-known minesweeper and Tetris games. I use the example of puzzle games in this situation because both are very similar in the sense that they are very easy to describe but complex in terms of strategies needed to solve them. </p>

<p>For this company the biggest drawback is their marketing strategies, which is the only way they will be able to achieve their targets. In this case the only way this “Puzzle” can be solved is by coming up with better marketing strategies which is creating this multimedia project which is an interactive website that will be an easier way for their customers to get clear information on the company and their products. This project will save a lot of extra costs which would be used for advertising and purchasing goods from the website directly.</p>
 
<p>In this time and age- with all the technology- it would not be advisable for this company to stick to the traditional methods of advertising and purchase of the goods. Therefore, I plan on taking this company to greater heights with this website where consumers are able to access all this information and purchase their goods from the comfort of their personal space.</p> 

<strong><p>What this website will consist of: </p></strong>
<p>•	<strong>Homepage-</strong> a fully functional homepage that will show what the company has to offer to the consumers, and what they expect to find on the website.</p>
<p>•	<strong>About-</strong> this is where the company’s origin story shall be posted. With the founder’s background on how he started the company. On top of that this page will also contain what the company does and specializes in. The mention of affiliations with local designers will also be included.</p>
<p>•	<strong>Gallery-</strong> Here, pictures of the latest and in-stock items shall be posted, in addition to that the consumer is also able to carry out their online transactions with the buy now button which will lead the customer to the store page.</p>
<p>•	<strong>Contact-</strong> consumers with any feedback on their experience with either the company or their website interaction, positive or negative, are able to submit their messages to the company on this page. Due to security threats against personal information, all you require is your email address.
<p>•	<strong>Store-</strong> this will be where the customer inputs their selected purchase item and their email address, from there on finalizing the purchase will be done through email due to security purposes for example internet fraud, which is when people take advantage of the customer’s personal information. Another reason for this is because some people in the host country don’t fully trust online transactions, by having the transactions taking place through personal emails this would make the customer feel safer.</p></p>

<p>Great benefits will be achieved from this project, for example: A larger customer platform will be acquired due flexibility the website will offer which is a 24/7 running website, higher profits will be attained due to the new and increased customer spread, the company will benefit from a lower number of labour hired, very little training will be required to run the website, easier stock control with all their items online. Many more benefits to both parties.</p>


<p>Assured decrease in advertising costs will be seen because  . With this website, the customers will be able to give feedback about their experience with the products and will also help improve customer service. </p>
</p></p>
<h4>Target Audience</h4>
<p>This multimedia project’s main objective is to attract customers, not everyone is interested in this type of fashion. Meaning that this will only appeal to those who have an eye for good fashion and enjoy trying new things. But that does not mean that it shall be restricted to only those who shop there, this website will be open for everyone, it would be to the companies’ advantage if they are able to make new customers and to change people’s taste in fashion.
<p><strong>Customers:</strong> With this website up and fully running, the customers will get the full experience of Athens Inc. With everything the need to know and learn about the company at their fingertips they will be able to make a well thought out decision and purchase their item. With the latest fashion in both women and men’s wear, old customers will spread the word to their friends and family and tell them about Athens thus increasing the number of customers. That’s why they are a big part of the target audience because the word will spread faster at no extra.</p>
<p><strong>Marketers:</strong> The main reason we are targeting marketers is because if we are able to sell the brand through the website they would deem it worthy to help us with the marketing and get it into international markets. This will be ensured by having all the company’s information online and have a user-friendly interactive site.</p>
<p><strong>Reviewers:</strong> In this case, the reviewers are bloggers and influential media personalities for example Youtubers. Through them we will be able to get the youth, which is our main audience, and this will be done by giving the bloggers special codes that will offer their viewers a discount on items in the store. With good deals a great number of customers will flock the website to make their purchases.</p>
<p><strong>Local designers:</strong> The reason why we would also like to appeal to local designers, is because this way we are able to keep new and original designs in the market. That will assure that customers will be regular with their purchases.</p> 
</p>
    
    <h4>Impacts on personnel and practices </h4>
    <p>•	Employees will need to undergo training on how to maintain, use and update the product.</p>
<p>•	The company might be forced to employ new staff to cope with the new and increased sales.</p>
<p>•	Regular updates and maintenance of the product will be required in order to prevent virus attacks, hacks or any other malicious attacks on product.</p>
<p>•	Better and increased wages for the employees due to the increased profits to the company.</p>
