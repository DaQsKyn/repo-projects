<h4>Areas of Risk</h4>
<p><strong>Unavailability of team members </strong>– Some things cannot be avoided for example- sickness -, if any of the team members fall ill, this will cause a drag to the project and therefore not meeting our deadlines.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Come up with a plan that will ensure flexibility for all of the team members.</p>
<p><strong>Client’s absence </strong>– If there is any event where the client is not able to make it to the review meetings, there could be a miscommunication of his vision of the project.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> The client should pass on the information of his ideas beforehand to avoid any inconvenience, or to conduct informal meetings with the project manager.</p>
<p><strong>Malfunctioning of equipment</strong> – Malfunctioning of the equipment is something that will cause great drag on the project, some of the systems could crash or some of the storage hardware could be misplaced. </p> 
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> One solution is that we could talk to the school to allow us to have the IT technician on site with us in-case of any system failure. </p>
<p><strong>Virus infection/accidental loss of work</strong> – A virus, or loss of work is something that could easily happen with such a big project, it will corrupt the system which might also lead to the product and all its files being deleted which will be detrimental to this project. </p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>  In the case of this happening we shall take great prevention measures to ensure the safety of our work, by installing the latest and best functioning anti-viruses in all computers and have a backup system in place. </p></p>
