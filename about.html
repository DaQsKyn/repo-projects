                    <h1> Athens Inc</h1>
                     
                       <p>Athens Incorporated, usually referred to as Athens Inc., is a Kenyan Fashion company, headquartered in Nairobi, Kenya, that designs and manufactures clothing and accessories originally focusing on outdoor attire, the fashion house has moved on to the high fashion market developing new and extravagant designs for the new market. Athens was registered on 06 July 2014 by Feisal Hasham when he was done with his course in fashion and design in the Domus University in Milan, Italy. He released his first design of cardigans and totes in 2015, by which time sales were up to Ksh 100,000. With such a positive start Feisal decided to make this his full-time job creating and developing new designs. They were made out of a tough military spec black nylon that his grandfather had used as coverings for steamer trunks. Initial success was not instant, as they were hard to sell due to the lack of advertising and high-prices.</p>

<p>Having only 1 branch in the city of Nairobi, Mr. Hasham decided that it was time for him to expand and grow his business, that is when he contacted me and told me about his idea of an interactive website. The new and unique fashion that this company offers is like none other, it has the potential to grow into an international brand. Together with traditional hand-made African jewelry. With the collaboration of local designers and Athen designers he was able to create this company.</p>

<p>Mr. Hasham realized that his previous methods of advertising did not reach to the greater market, with initial methods like newspaper articles, radio and word of mouth. That is when he came to me with the idea of this multimedia project which would benefit him with marketing. </p>
